# NBA Stats 🏀

This is a calculator based on data retrieved from the "balldontlie" API.
It calculates the averages of a player before and after a major injury.

For example, Demarcus Cousins had achillies injury during 2019, 
so the calculator takes data from 2015-2018 and 2020-2021 
(excluding bubble season).
