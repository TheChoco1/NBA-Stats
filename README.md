# NBA Stats 🏀

This is a calculator based on data retrieved from the "balldontlie" API from 2015-2022.
It calculates the averages of a player before and after their first major injury.

For example, Demarcus Cousins had his first major injury during the 
2018-2019 season, so the calculator takes data from 2015-2018 and 2020-2021 
(excluding the bubble season due to inaccurate results).
